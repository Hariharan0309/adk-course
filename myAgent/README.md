# Basic Chat Agent

This is a simple conversational agent built with the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK).

## Description

The agent uses the `gemini-2.5-flash` model to answer user questions to the best of its knowledge. It is a minimal example demonstrating the basic setup of an `Agent`.

## How to Run

Ensure you have the Google ADK installed and configured.

1. Navigate to the project root directory (`adk-course`).

2. Run the agent using the ADK web interface:
   ```bash
   adk web
   ```
